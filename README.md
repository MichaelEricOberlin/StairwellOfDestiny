# StairwellOfDestiny
Simple game involving battling a dragon in an extremely biased environment.

Control your knight with A and D for movement left and right, and W for higher bounces. Try and defeat the dragon by striking it from above, much like in the classic game "Joust"; striking it from below (as well as its fireballs) will hurt you.
